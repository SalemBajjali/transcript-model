Introduction
!!!!!!!!!!!!

The GA4GH GKS Sequence Annotation (SA) subgroup is developing a model to define the concept of a transcript. The model is intended to define core elements, align where possible with existing formats (e.g., GFF), and both leverage and be used by the `Variation Representation Specification (VRS) <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/latest/index.html>`__ and the `Variant Annotation (VA) <https://github.com/sujaypatil96/ga4gh-va>`__ Framework.

The SA subgroup created an `example <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k5aqgj6hZ0YMZ26Qda43qlLUagJFN2Fi/edit#slide=id.g15f165633aa_1_0>`__ of a transcript and related data, which was used as reference material in a distributed modeling exercise among subgroup members.

Those example data were used to develop `draft conceptual and logical models <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WdDSpr3XqSt9TXp_iyr2FiCBM4BANbL6JM24H1I6UjE/edit#slide=id.p>`__, which were used as a basis for the content in these pages.

Note that all content is DRAFT and does not represent the consensus view of or endorsement by the SA subgroup.
