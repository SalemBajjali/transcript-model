Introduction
!!!!!!!!!!!!

The GA4GH GKS Sequence Annotation (SA) subgroup is developing a model to define the concept of a transcript. The model is intended to define core elements, align where possible with existing formats (e.g., GFF), and both leverage and be used by the Variation Representation Specification (VRS) and the Variation Annotation Framework.

The SA subgroup created an example of a transcript and related data, which was used to develop this draft model.

TO DO:
 - `Variation Representation Specification (VRS) <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/latest/index.html>`__
 - `Variant Annotation (VA) <https://github.com/sujaypatil96/ga4gh-va>`__
 - `Sequence Annotation Example <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k5aqgj6hZ0YMZ26Qda43qlLUagJFN2Fi/edit#slide=id.g15f165633aa_1_0>`__
