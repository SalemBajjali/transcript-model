Terminology and Information Model 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is a DRAFT information model that was developed as part of the GA4GH GKS SA subgroup's exercise to model sequence features and transcripts. It is a work in progress.

This information model was derived from the `draft conceptual and logical models <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WdDSpr3XqSt9TXp_iyr2FiCBM4BANbL6JM24H1I6UjE/edit#slide=id.p>`__ that were developed as foundational work for this effort. Please reference those models in addition to this documentation (which is incomplete).

Note: Some elements are sourced from the `Variation Representation Specification (VRS) <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/latest/index.html>`__ and others from the `HL7 Clinical Genomics FHIR Molecular Sequence Resource <https://build.fhir.org/branches/cg-im-molseq-work_in_progress/molecularsequence.html>`__. This draft model was aligned to those specifications as much as possible while still achieving the goals of the SA modeling exercise.

  Draft SA Model

   **Legend** DRAFT model of Annotated Sequence, Transcript, and building blocks (including Sequence and SequenceFeature). See the `conceptual and logical models <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WdDSpr3XqSt9TXp_iyr2FiCBM4BANbL6JM24H1I6UjE/edit#slide=id.p>`__ for rationale, design choices, and examples.


Core Classes
@@@@@@@@@@@@

.. _Sequence:

Sequence
$$$$$$$$

The definition of Sequence is conceptually identical to `VRS Sequence <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/stable/terms_and_model.html#sequence>`__, but the information model is more detailed.

A *sequence* is a contiguous, linear polymer of nucleic acid or amino acid Residues. Sequences are the prevalent representation of these polymers, particularly in the domain of variant representation.

.. _LocatedFeature:

LocatedFeature
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

A *located feature* is a mapping of a sequence feature to a location on a sequence.

.. include:: defs/DSAM/LocatedFeature.rst

.. _SequenceFeature:

SequenceFeature
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

A *sequence feature* is a structural or functional feature that can be annotated on a Sequence.

.. include:: defs/DSAM/SequenceFeature.rst



.. _SequenceContext:

SequenceContext
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

A *sequence context* is the definition of a location on a sequence.

.. include:: defs/DSAM/SequenceContext.rst 

.. _Annotated-Sequence:

Annotated Sequence
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

An *annotated sequence* is a sequence that contains annotations (e.g., features).

$$$$$$$$$$

A *transcript* is a type of annotated sequence.
